# PaintClone

A microsoft paint inspired application.
I tried to recreate as many features as possible.
I could have spend many more month working on this, but at a certain point I felt like it was time to lay the project to rest for now.
The result is far from perfect, but I learned a whole lot in the process.
The code unfortunately is pretty messy and coming back to it after several weeks I had a hard time retracing my steps.
Something I definitely need to work on going forward.
